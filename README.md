Flappy Bird Clone

A simple yet addictive Flappy Bird game built using Unity and C#. This project is a clone of the original Flappy Bird game and features:

- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- Endless scrolling terrain
- Collision detection and scoring system
- Basic graphics and sound effects

This project was created as a personal exercise in game development and is intended to serve as a portfolio piece..

Features:

- Endless gameplay
- High score tracking

Technologies used:

- Unity

Note: I'm still working on ironing out some kinks, increasing pipe difficulty, adding sounds, and enhancing the background.
